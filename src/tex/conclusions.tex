To forecast ILI over a range of Latin American countries, we have
explored a gamut of options pertaining to data sources, fusion
possibilities, and corrections to track a moving target. Our results
demonstrate that there are significant opportunities to improve
forecasting performance and selective superiorities among data sources
that can be leveraged.  Our future work focuses on reconciling the
phenomenological models developed here with true epidemiological models
to that we can develop not just near-term forecasts as done here but
also identify long-range characteristics of the epidemic as it unfolds.
We also aim to explore the inter-country characteristics of ILI
profiles in future.
