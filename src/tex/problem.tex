In this section, we formally describe the problem.
Let,  
\[\mathcal{P} = \langle {P}_1, {P}_2, \dots,{P}_T \rangle\]
denote the known total weekly ILI case count for the country under
consideration , where ${P}_t$  denotes the case count for
the time point $t$.\\
Also let $T$ denote the time point till which ILI case count is known.
%\prithwish{Will have to decide later whether we want to specify PAHO
  %here $\rightarrow$ \textnormal{``as reported by the Pan-American Health Organization
%(PAHO)~\cite{PAHO:2013}''}}\\
Corresponding to the ILI case count data, let us denote the available surrogate informations
for the same country by 
\[\mathcal{X} = \langle \mathcal{X}_1, \mathcal{X}_2, \dots, \mathcal{X}_{T1}\rangle\]
, where $T1$ is the time point till which the surrogate
information is known and $\mathcal{X}_{t}$ denotes the surrogate attributes for time
point $t$. 

Then the problem we want to solve is to find a predictive model ($f$)  for the 
case count data, as presented formally in equation~\ref{eq:problem}.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:problem}
  f: \mathcal{P}_t = f\left(\mathcal{P}, \mathcal{X}\right)
\end{equation}
