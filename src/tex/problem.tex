In this section, we formally introduce the problem. Let
$\mathcal{P} = \langle {P}_1, {P}_2, \dots,{P}_T \rangle$
denote the known total weekly ILI case count for the country under
consideration, where ${P}_t$  denotes the case count for
time point $t$ and $T$ denotes the time point till which the
ILI case count is known.
%\prithwish{Will have to decide later whether we want to specify PAHO
  %here $\rightarrow$ \textnormal{``as reported by the Pan-American Health Organization
%(PAHO)~\cite{PAHO:2013}''}}\\
Corresponding to the ILI case count data, let us denote the available surrogate information
for the same country
 by 
$\mathcal{X} = \langle \mathcal{X}_1, \mathcal{X}_2, \dots, \mathcal{X}_{T1}\rangle$, 
where $T1$ is the time point till which the surrogate
information is available and $\mathcal{X}_{t}$ denotes the surrogate attributes for time
point $t$. 
The problem we desire to solve is to find a predictive model ($f$) for the 
case count data, as presented formally in Eqn~\ref{eq:problem}.

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:problem}
  f: \mathcal{P}_t = f\left(\mathcal{P}, \mathcal{X}\right)

\end{equation}

In this paper, in order to better understand the importance of different sources,
we assume that the ILI activities in different countries are
independent of each other.
