By using multiple methods like pseudo query expansion and correlation analysis using Google Correlate we built a vocabulary of 151 words (both in Spanish and English) that were found to be closely associated with flu. To begin with, our subject matter experts provided us with a set of words that were associated with the flu. These included symptoms, medical synonyms and effects. This set was used as the initial seed for pseudo query expansion, wherein the top 20 web sites returned by Google search for each of these words were crawled. Apart from this, the official CDC website and equivalent websites in each country detailing the causes,symptoms and treatment for influenza was also crawled. Additionally some hand picked websites such as http://www.flufacts.com and http://health.yahoo.net/channel/flu_treatments were also crawled. This entire corpus was then normalized by removing stop words and using porter stemming, post which the words were ranked according to the number of occurrences. The top 500 words for each language was selected. 
Google Correlate is/was a part of Google Trends which allowed users to query the most correlated words in terms of their search volume. Correlate also had a nifty tool wherein one could provide an arbitrary time series and get back a list of words whose search volume was most correlated to the given time series. For our vocabulary building exercise, the ILI case counts published by PAHO on their official website http://ais.paho.org/phip/viz/ed_flu.asp was used to create a time series. For each country, this time series was then fed into Google's Correlate engine and the top 20 correlated words were obtained. These words were a mix of both English and Spanish. As an added exercise, the case count time series was shifted to the left by upto 2 weeks in order to capture the words searched leading up to actual flu infection. Similarly, we shifted the time series to the right to capture the words commonly searched during the tail of the infection. This entire exercise provided us some interesting terms like "ginger" which has been used as a natural herbal remedy in the eastern world. Also, many medications like oseltamivir and tamiflu were found to be highly correlated.   
The set of terms obtained from query expansion and correlation analysis were then pruned by hand to obtain the final vocabulary used by the model.
